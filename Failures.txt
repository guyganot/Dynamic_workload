# Failure Modes

A document detailing failure modes and how to deal with them if this was a real-world project.

## 1. Infrastructure Failures

### Failure Mode:
- Unavailability of cloud resources, such as instances, load balancers, or databases.
- Network connectivity issues.
- Hardware or software failures.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement automated monitoring systems to detect infrastructure failures and downtime.
- Utilize load balancing and redundancy techniques to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.
- Regularly back up data and create disaster recovery plans to restore functionality in case of failures.
- Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to handle increased traffic or resource demands.
- Use a cloud provider with a reliable infrastructure and well-established SLAs (Service Level Agreements).

## 2. Software and Application Failures

### Failure Mode:
- Bugs, errors, or crashes in the software code.
- Incompatibilities or conflicts between software components.
- Insufficient error handling and exception management.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Employ thorough testing practices, including unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing, to identify and fix software defects.
- Implement error handling mechanisms and proper exception management to gracefully handle failures and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- Use version control systems and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to track code changes, automate builds, and deploy stable versions of the software.
- Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to capture and analyze application logs for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
- Employ a robust incident management process to address and resolve software failures promptly.

## 3. Data Loss or Corruption

### Failure Mode:
- Accidental deletion or corruption of critical data.
- Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Insufficient backup and recovery mechanisms.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement regular data backups and establish backup storage systems to prevent data loss.
- Employ data encryption techniques to protect sensitive information at rest and in transit.
- Implement access controls and user authentication mechanisms to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly test data backup and recovery processes to verify their effectiveness.
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations and industry best practices.

## 4. External Service Dependencies

### Failure Mode:
- Outages or disruptions in external services or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that the project relies on.
- Performance issues or increased response times from third-party services.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Identify critical external service dependencies and monitor their status and performance.
- Implement mechanisms to handle service outages gracefully, such as caching data, displaying informative error messages to users, or failing over to alternative services.
- Use retry mechanisms and timeouts when making requests to external services to handle transient failures and prevent cascading failures in the project.
- Consider implementing service level agreements (SLAs) with third-party service providers to ensure timely resolution of issues and minimize downtime.

## 5. Human Errors and Operational Mistakes

### Failure Mode:
- Configuration errors in the infrastructure or application settings.
- Mismanagement of deployment processes or code releases.
- Insufficient training or lack of awareness among team members.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) practices to automate and standardize the deployment and configuration of the project's infrastructure.
- Use version control systems and deployment pipelines to manage code releases and ensure consistent and controlled deployments.
- Conduct regular training sessions and knowledge sharing activities to enhance team members' skills and awareness of best practices.
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access to critical systems and

 minimize the risk of unauthorized configuration changes.
- Conduct thorough code reviews and implement quality assurance processes to catch potential errors before deployment.
